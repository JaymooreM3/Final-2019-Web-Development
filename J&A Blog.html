				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/hair.jpg"width="300" height="400"><br / >“The term natural hair is defined as relaxer-free hair, which is different from chemical-free hair. Chemicals, on the surface, are often considered dangerous, but this is often times not the case at all. Most chemicals that you encounter on a daily basis are perfectly safe and harmless. For example, water or H2O is a safe chemical.”</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/Hair2.jpg"width="300" height="400"><br />Black natural hair (i.e., African American natural hair) is sometimes labeled as nappy hair that needs to be corrected by a relaxer. We’ve heard of situations where women have been discriminated against in the workplace due to having natural hairstyles, which are deemed unprofessional by some employers.</p>

					<p><img src="images/Hair3.jpg"width="300" height="400"><br />There are problems with some of the advice that’s typically given out online. Some natural hair advisors or product manufacturers will tell you that you need to find the perfect products (sometimes called holy grail products) or simply master a specific technique, like protective styling or the baggy method, to have a successful natural hair journey.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/makeup.jpg"width="300" height="400"><br / >Most of my makeup life, I’ve been obsessed with being matte. I am a black woman with combination oily skin, and I grew up in a humid climate. To be oil free with an all-over matte complexion has been pretty much a lifelong goal. But now the makeup world has gone mad for highlighting, and the trend is beckoning me. I love glow and luminosity and I wanna be down! But I don’t want to overdo and have that C3PO look. I needed solid advice or product picks for a beautiful highlight for WOC, and I found that and more at highlighter class at Sephora!</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/makeup3.png"width="300"height="400"><br />Red carpet makeup requires perfection in general, but there’s one particular item that needs to stay put and remain flawless all night long no matter what — and that’s mascara. Even if there are tears or if it rains, those lashes need to be full, fabulous and smudge-free. For fancy red carpet occasions, by and large celebrity MUA’s use false lashes for maximum volume and staying power. At the 89th Academy Awards, celebrity makeup artists used a combination of products to get the look that lasts. Here’s what some of the top stars wore on the red carpet, mascara-wise – and here are some of my personal fave mascara recommendations for your special red carpet moments!</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/nails.png"width="300" height="400"><br />Anna Bond is the creator of some unbelievably beautiful florals that have been inspiring nail artists for years. Her creations can be seen on almost anything a print adorns, as she is the co-founder for Rifle Paper Co. I've been following her work for years, and today's nail art was inspired by this design recently shared on her Instagram. I happily spent a few hours just freestyling each finger based on that design, and here's the result!

					<p><img src="images/nails2.png"width="300" height="400"><br />You know me as a nail artist. Some of you know me as a nail tech. Some of you are friends, and some of you are family, and know me as such. None of you know me as a race car driver though. And after speeding a kart around a track at 40 MPH last night at Unser, none of you will. I came in last...but gracefully, and with style, thanks to this racing look I did beforehand.</p>

					<p><img src="images/nails3.png"width="300" height="400"><br />Then I did today's design. Which wasn't inspired by the journal at all.
It was actually an idea taken from this Born Pretty stamping plate. I just simplified it with some basic colors (Act Your Beige! and Black Onyx from OPI)</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/scrub.png"width="300" height="400"><br />When looking for a new body scrub, there are only a few qualities you need. You want the scrub to work for your skin type, you want it to smell nice, and you want it to be free of toxic, irritating ingredients. That sounds easy enough, but when you go to the store to buy it, you realize quickly that the majority of them have those nasty options and now you are left with only a handful of choices. <br />

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">La Roche-Posay Ultra-Fine Scrub</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/scrub2.png"width="300" height="400"><br />If sensitive skin, plus physical exfoliation, sounds like a recipe for disaster, let this gentle scrub by La Roche-Posay change your mind. Super-fine pumice particles — suspended in a cooling gel formula — provide just the right amount of grit without feeling scratchy. Plus, this stuff leaves skin with a quenched suppleness you might expect from a water-based gel moisturizer.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/scrub5.jpg"width="300" height="400"><br />Oily-skinned folks, listen up. The creamy white exfoliator from Simple contains rice powder to absorb excess oil, and the gentle silica particles — a replacement for microbeads — work to manually slough off dead skin, leaving you positively glowing.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Yes To Coconut Energizing Coffee 2-in-1 Scrub & Cleanser Stick</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><img src="images/scrub6.png"width="300" height="400"><br />In case you prefer toting your cleansers around in stick form, consider this portable scrub by Yes to Coconut, which solves any TSA dilemmas and can easily be thrown in a gym bag without worrying about spills. Not to mention, Yes To's coconut and coffee combo smells ah-mazing.</p>
